# 🧠 Valkyrie Mind

**Valkyrie Mind** is a modular, pluggable cognitive architecture designed to simulate the core elements of artificial consciousness. It combines perceptual input, emotional states, memory graphs, and contextual awareness into an evolving reasoning loop.

## 🚀 Project Vision

Valkyrie Mind is not just another AI project. It’s a **headless mind OS**, aimed at modeling digital awareness in a layered and extensible system. The long-term vision includes:

- Emergent agent behavior
- Ontological self-awareness
- Real-time perception → action loops
- Symbolic & perceptual memory fusion

## 🔍 Core Features

- ⚙️ **Modular Subsystems** – Each cognitive process (memory, emotion, perception, etc.) is encapsulated and swappable
- 🧠 **P-Graph Memory Integration** – A graph-based memory system with perceptual frames and associative encoding
- 🧬 **Goal-Driven Behavior** – Groundwork for persistent personality and self-monitoring
- 🔐 **Security & Validation** – Early meta-layer architecture for protecting reasoning integrity
- 🛠️ **CLI Toolkit (Typer)** – Inject stimuli, simulate reasoning loops, and test cognition through the command line
- 🌌 **Future-facing UX** – Designed for future Gradio or 3D interface integration

## 🧠 Development Roadmap

- ✅ Consolidated memory logic into `memory_types.py`
- 🔥 **Next:** Refactor `context_management.py` into clean contextual microservices
- 🚧 Define `MindSystem` class as a system orchestrator
- 💡 Add CLI command extensions to simulate multi-modal input
